# Playground Laravel

This a project built to test out laravel to the fullest. In this project:

-   I test out different aspects of laravel
-   Store various UI components from the internet
-   Test out any idea I want to apply in a real world project here first before it makes it way into other projects.
-   Use as a starting point for various projects I want to build

This project is basically a store of knowledge for me in all things laravel (not including inertiajs, will build a seperate project to test those out).
